# Hello Git!

Hello Git is a program that allows voice interaction with a Git repository. Use
voice commands like "Create a new repository" or "Switch to a branch" to make
your repository hop-to and work for you!

## Download

To download this project, clone the `stable` branch of its repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/robojamison/hello-git.git hello-git
```

## Installation

To install and run Hello Git you will need to build it from source:

```
TBA
```

## Compatibility

Hello Git was written and tested on Ubuntu Linux and compatibility with other
operating systems (especially Win32 or Mac systems) is not guaranteed.

## Issues

If you found a bug or want to request a feature, create a ticket in the
(Issues Tracker)[https://github.com/robojamison/hello-git/issues].

## Inspiration

I was inspirted to create this project by the difficulty that I had when I
originally set out to learn Git. At the time there were no pretty GUI interfaces
such as the ones that GitHub and other companies are distributing now, there was
only the command-line. Since I am a basement-dwelling bearded hacker in all but
beard, I recommend that people learn to use the Git CLI first then move on to
the GUI tools, however for some people that's just not an option.

This project is my implementation of what I think is an easy way for beginners
to learn to use and love Git. By using voice commands to tell their repository
what they want to do, hopefully they will learn to use Git as easily as they 
learned to use their smartphones!

## Technology

Hello Git was programmed using [C++ 11][1] and the [GNU Compiler Collection][2],
and voice recognition and synthesis was implemented using the [Voce][3] library.
Source code was written using [GNU Emacs][4] on [Ubuntu Linux][5], aided by the
[Z shell][6] and [Oh My Zsh][7].
